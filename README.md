# WEM-130 | Selenium Bootcamp


## SUBMISSION PROCESS:

### Deadline: 
* July 16th, 2023 @ 10AM

### Instructions 
* Clone the project locally, in your IdeaProjects directory, or any other desired directory
```sh
git clone https://github.com/samipiit/SeleniumBootcamp.git
```
* Create your remote repo on Github with the following naming convention: `3472NY_Sami_Selenium_Bootcamp`
* Add your [remote repo URL here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eug1sL2WV2i8-gCE69bxGwM5ZQNyRC8P6izQVPQggO8/edit#gid=0)
* Connect your local repo to your remote repo
```sh
git remote set-url origin <your_repo_URL>
```
* Verify your working copy is pointing to the correct repo
```sh
git remote -v
```
* Make sure to push the framework to your remote repo immediately, so that you have the base framework available
* Make sure to do this next step only after you've pushed the framework to your remote
    * Inside each module except for `base`, under `src/main/java` and `src/main/test` you will find files titled 
    `delete_this_file.txt` Only delete these files once you have created at least 1 class under these directories. 
    If you delete these files and there is nothing else in the directory, when you push to your remote, Git will exclude 
    the directory entirely. 
* It's recommended to create and maintain a new feature branch for each module you are working on. Once you have completed
* test development for a particular module/application, you can then merge that feature branch into your main.
* You should be pushing **STABLE CODE ONLY** & you should be pushing as soon as you can confirm a test case is passing 
consistently (run test 2-3x to confirm)
  - Best practice on the job, is to push your code every time you solve a problem, make a change, or finish a task
  - ***IMPORTANT: DO NOT PUSH ANY CODE CONTAINING ANY ERRORS, OR ANY INCOMPLETE CODE***
#
### TO DO:
* You are responsible for developing 120 test cases
  * 90% of your tests should be data-driven
    * Either data-drive your tests or access data to assert against, from an external source 
* You must work with at least 10 different web applications (12 tests/application)
  * You are welcome to automate all 14 applications, in order to reduce the number of tests required per 
  application
* You must test across all 8 available domains (see below for list of domains)
* You should document/maintain your test cases in a text file (perhaps a .txt file in src/test/resources, for each module)
* You must develop at least 10 high value E2E test cases for FreeCRM
    * Look at all the functionality this application allows you to do - Log a call, add a new contact, add new companies, 
    scheduling calendar events, etc

## REMINDERS:
`**DO NOT MESS WITH ANY POM.XML FILE, UNLESS YOU TRULY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING**`
- To utilize JDBC, create a schema instance for each module in MySQL Workbench. Then, navigate to `src/main/resources/config.properties`
for each corresponding module, and ensure your `MYSQLJDBC.host` property value contains the correct schema. Don't forget to initialize MySQL prior to running tests!
- When running tests from a Test Class, you need to make sure the method in the Page_Object class, 
named `driverSetup (@BeforeMethod)`, has an optional parameter `URL`, with the value of the website you are testing. 
    - If running tests from the xml file, then the `URL` parameter should point to the application homepage
- If you would like your test to automatically retry upon failure, annotate the test method with `@RetryCount(n)` 
    where `n` equals the number of times to retry
    - If you are running from the Test Class and would like your tests to retry on failure, then you need to add the 
    following parameter to the `@Test` annotation: 
    
        `retryAnalyzer = RetryAnalyzer.class`
    
    - If you are running from the TestNGRunner.xml, then make sure you have the AnnotationTransfer class identified as 
    a listener. (This has already been done, in all the runner.xml files)
        
        ```
      <listeners>
             <listener class-name="listeners.AnnotationTransformer"/>
      </listeners>
      ```
- When you run the Maven Clean lifecycle, you will also be cleaning out all existing test reports
    - In order to keep all your reports, you must go to the **ROOT** POM.xml and comment out lines 112-117 
    (The entire `<filesets>` tag)
- If you are copying and pasting code frequently, it probably means you should turn that workflow/action into a method
- Your goal should be to write code that is highly re-usable and can be used in a wide variety of situations  
- Try to come up with helper methods that can help with assertions (i.e. - compare list of expected results from your 
    excel sheet against a list of WebElement text that was retrieved during test execution, and return true if both 
    lists are equal)
- At the end of the bootcamp, you should be able to confidently run your entire project (all modules), by executing `mvn clean install -U`
  - You must have the path to the Maven executable in your `PATH` environment variable, in order to run `mvn` commands in your terminal/cmd



#### ***ENJOY THE PROCESS & GOOD LUCK!***
